The objective of this project is to create an immersive 3D simulation of an asteroid field in space. The 
project requires developing an interactive environment using WebGL through the Three.js library. It 
integrates several advanced graphics techniques such as custom GLSL shaders for realistic lighting 
effects, dynamic object generation (asteroids and meteors), interactive camera controls, and collision 
avoidance mechanisms. Additionally, it features a spaceship model with keyboard-controlled 
movement and interactive texture switching.
